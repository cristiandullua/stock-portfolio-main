# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to enhance my Java programming skills, I developed a Stock Portfolio Application as a means to showcase my understanding of Java language concepts and to further my learning in software development.

The Stock Portfolio Application is a Java-based software that enables users to manage their stock portfolios. It allows users to create new portfolios, add stock records with details like ticker symbol, price, date, and amount, calculate the current price, and determine profit/loss based on the entered data.

The primary purpose behind creating this software was to demonstrate proficiency in Java programming, particularly in working with Swing for the graphical user interface, handling file I/O operations, parsing JSON data from an API, and applying basic data manipulation and validation techniques.

For a detailed walkthrough of the application and the code, you can watch the demonstration on [Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/14cfcb7fe1254ee49a1caffa019a1a6c?sid=598aa0a1-8bd9-459f-a604-908dab9231e7). The 4-5 minute demo covers the software in action and highlights various aspects of Java language syntax utilized in the project.

# Development Environment

The Stock Portfolio Application was developed using the following tools:

- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: javax.swing, org.json
- **API**: Alpha Vantage API

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites were valuable resources:

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

# Future Work

Moving forward, here are some improvements and additions planned for the Stock Portfolio Application:

- Implementing user authentication and secure data storage
- Enhancing the UI/UX for a more intuitive user experience
- Adding support for multiple portfolios and sorting/filtering options
- Add the functionality to periodically update the stock prices
